# Universal Modular Generation (UMG)

**Universal Modular Generation (UMG)** is a novel, technology-agnostic framework for generating cognition by composing modular units of meaning into explicit, inspectable structure—independent of models, runtimes, or execution systems.

UMG operates at the **Cognitive Specification Layer (CSL)**, a layer that defines *what a cognitive system should do* without executing it.  
It enables cognition to be authored, merged, governed, and compiled through deterministic synthesis into auditable specifications.

This repository contains the canonical UMG specification, along with documentation, schemas, examples, and reference tooling.

## What problem does UMG solve?

Modern AI systems often encode cognition implicitly through:

- large prompts  
- agent scripts  
- hidden control logic  
- opaque orchestration layers  

These approaches tightly couple *intent* with *execution*, making systems difficult to reason about, audit, reuse, or adapt across models and runtimes.

UMG introduces a **specification-first approach to cognition**.

Rather than encoding behavior directly, cognition is defined as a structured specification that can be validated, compiled, inspected, and traced before any execution occurs.

## What is Universal Modular Generation?

UMG began with a simple premise:

**any meaningful idea can be treated as a modular unit, and cognition can be generated by composing those units.**

Early applications of UMG interpreted these compositions as prompts for language models.  
This demonstrated modular cognitive generation, but execution via prompting was an application choice—not a defining property of the framework.

As UMG matured, its principles were formalized into an explicit Cognitive Specification Layer.

## Core concepts (high level)

- **Cognitive Specification Layer (CSL)**  
  A formal abstraction for defining intended cognition independently of execution.

- **Universal Modular Generation (UMG)**  
  A modular framework for specifying cognition using:
  - structured blocks
  - explicit ordering (MOLT)
  - merge semantics for creating new cognitive intent
  - deterministic synthesis
  - priority and governance for conflict resolution

- **UMG Studio**  
  Reference tooling for authoring, compiling, and inspecting UMG specifications.

These concepts are intentionally separated:
- CSL defines the category  
- UMG defines the framework  
- Studio provides the tooling

## What UMG provides

- A formal specification for cognitive structure
- Explicit merge semantics for composing meaning
- Deterministic synthesis into compiled structures
- Priority and governance rules for conflict resolution
- A compiler model that produces:
  - a **RuntimeSpec** (what is active)
  - a **Trace** (how decisions were derived)
- Clear separation between:
  - specification
  - compilation
  - execution

UMG does **not** execute models or simulate intelligence.  
It generates cognitive structure, not behavior.

## Repository structure (overview)

- `/spec` — canonical, versioned specifications (authoritative)  
- `/docs` — conceptual and historical documentation  
- `/schemas` — machine-readable schemas  
- `/examples` — example specifications and outputs  
- `/apps/umg-studio` — reference tooling  
- `/packages/compiler` — reference compiler  
- `/archive` — historical and experimental material  

If any conflict exists, the specification under `/spec` takes precedence.

---

## Status

UMG is currently in **alpha / research preview**.

Core framework concepts are stable.  
Tooling and ergonomics continue to evolve.
