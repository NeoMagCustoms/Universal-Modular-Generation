## Definition

**Universal Modular Generation (UMG)** is a formal framework for generating
cognition by composing **modular units of meaning** into explicit cognitive structure.

UMG operates entirely within the **Cognitive Specification Layer (CSL)** and defines
how cognition may be authored, combined, governed, and compiled as a specification,
independent of execution.

---

## Core Principle

The core principle of UMG is:

> Any cognitive concept can be represented as a modular unit, and cognition can be
> generated by composing those units according to explicit structural rules.

UMG treats cognition as something that can be **constructed**, not inferred or learned,
through deterministic composition.

---

## Modular Units

UMG represents cognition using discrete units called **blocks**.

Blocks may represent:
- goals
- rules
- constraints
- instructions
- heuristics
- abstract ideas
- contextual modifiers

UMG places no semantic restriction on *what* a block represents.
Only its **structural role** and **composition rules** are specified.

---

## Composition and Generation

UMG defines cognition generation through explicit composition mechanisms, including:

- ordering of blocks through a formal grammar
- grouping of blocks without semantic fusion
- merging of blocks to create new cognitive intent
- synthesis of composed structures into compiled form

These mechanisms allow cognition to be generated as structure rather than encoded as behavior.

---

## Universality

UMG is **universal** in scope.

It does not restrict:
- the domain of cognition
- the type of system being specified
- the execution environment
- the representational substrate

Any system capable of interpreting structured cognition may operate on UMG specifications.

---

## Determinism

UMG requires that all composition and resolution rules be **explicit and deterministic**.

Given the same specification inputs, a UMG-compliant compiler must produce the same
structural outputs.

This determinism enables:
- auditability
- reproducibility
- inspection
- reliable reuse

---

## Relationship to Execution

UMG does **not** define execution semantics.

Execution systems may interpret UMG specifications as:
- prompts
- agent policies
- control rules
- decision graphs
- or other runtime representations

Such interpretations are external to UMG and do not alter the specification itself.

---

## Relationship to CSL

UMG operates **within** the Cognitive Specification Layer.

CSL defines the abstraction boundary.  
UMG defines a concrete framework inside that boundary.

UMG is compliant with CSL by construction.

---

## Summary

Universal Modular Generation defines a way to **generate cognition as structure**.

It provides explicit, modular, and deterministic mechanisms for composing meaning
without coupling cognition to execution.
